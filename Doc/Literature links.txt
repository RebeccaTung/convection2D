Literature links:1. http://gme.unizar.es/acntaba/uploads/6/3/5/8/6358488/Puigjaner2.pdfUseful presentation about applying numerical continuation to convection problems. Contains info on how to trace several solution branches as well as periodic solutions.2. http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~kouzn101/NBA/hb.pdfDocument where the mathematical equations of the continuation problem are derived. These equations are then to be solved numerically by the continuation algorithms. Contains info about the way AUTO, CONTENT and MATCONT identify and calculate various types of bifurcations.

Chose manually 3 values of Gr and ran initial_guess simulations.

ds  between point 2 (gr=1.7e-6) and point 3 (gr=3e-6) is
ds = 0.026146068099760434

ds_old between point 1 (gr=1e-6) and point 2 (gr=1.7e-6) is
ds_old = 0.010300165599414025

USING the temperature at the centre for norm

Let's use those values to debug the iteration.i file...
